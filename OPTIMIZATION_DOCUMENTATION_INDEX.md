## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS BY PHASE

### Phase 1: Confidence Scoring (Week 1)
**Track:**
- Percentage increase in A-grade opportunities
- Average confidence score of recommendations

**Success:** >20% increase in A-grade recommendations

**How to measure:**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN investmentGrade = 'A+' THEN 1 END) as a_plus,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN investmentGrade = 'A' THEN 1 END) as a_grade,
  COUNT(*) as total
FROM opportunities
WHERE date(created_at) >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
```

---

### Phase 4: AI Optimization (Week 2)
**Track:**
- AI API cost per scan
- Number of items analyzed per scan

**Success:** Cost drops from $2/scan to $0.05/scan (40x improvement!)

**How to measure:**
```
Check OpenRouter invoice
Before: ~$2/day = $60/month
After: ~$0.05/day = $1.50/month
Savings: $58.50/month
```

---

### Phase 2+5: Multi-Scan System (Weeks 3-4)
**Track:**
- Flash opportunities found per week
- Swing opportunities found per week
- Overall portfolio opportunities

**Success:**
- Flash: 1-2 spikes detected daily
- Swing: 4-6 opportunities per week
- Core: 2-4 opportunities per week
- Total: 7-12 flips/week (vs 2-4 before)

**How to measure:**
```sql
SELECT 
  tier,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(hold_days) as avg_hold,
  SUM(profit_gp) as total_profit
FROM completed_flips
WHERE DATE(closed_date) >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY tier
```
